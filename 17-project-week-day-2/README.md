# Class 17 -  Project Week: Milestone 2
## Development phase

This should be a huge day of productivity, with tons of code written and projects truly beginning to take shape. A few helpful safety tips:

 1. Be deliberate and careful with Git. Stick to the plans and processes you set out Friday (or over the weekend). Know that there will be glitches that happen, particularly merge conflicts. No worries, just resolve them as they appear.

 2. Don't forget that pair programming is a great way to keep things moving forward and to keep everyone on the team engaged and fresh.

 3. Get up from your laptops and walk around from time to time.  Frequent breaks enhance productivity.

 4. Have regular meetings with your teams, away from laptops, to discuss process and product and make sure everyone is comfortable and clear with how things are going.

 5. Always keep the experience of your end user in mind. Deliberately take time to view your app as if you are seeing it for the very first time.

6. Most important: Be focused and relentless toward achieving your core functionality. By now you should have identified your biggest challenges and toughest problems. Solve them this morning if you have not solved them already. Do not get lured by the siren song of CSS and images and making things pretty. Save that for later.
